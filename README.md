## 1. Dataset Preparation
* A total of 5 different publicly available retinal image datasets were used for experimentation purpose. Please download the datasets from the following official address: [DRIVE](https://drive.grand-challenge.org/), [STARE]( https://cecas.clemson.edu/~ahoover/stare/), [CHASE_DB1]( https://blogs.kingston.ac.uk/retinal/chasedb1/), [DIARET_DB1](http://www.it.lut.fi/project/imageret/diaretdb1/), [HRF]( https://www5.cs.fau.de/research/data/fundus-images/). These datasets consist of the retinal images, its manual segmentation, mask. We also used some proprietary dataset.
